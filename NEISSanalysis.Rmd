# NEISS Analysis

This is an example html file that was generated from R. This data set comes from the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics), and contains data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). For more information on codes, see the [NEISS Coding Manual](https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/2017NEISSCodingManualCPSConlyNontrauma.pdf). It is important to note, for example, that a child aged nine months will have an age code of 209. You might find some of the ages suspicious if you didn't know that.
